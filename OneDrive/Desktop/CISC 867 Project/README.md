# Modelling NBA Playerâ€™s Performances based on Interviews

This repository is the official implementation of [Modelling NBA Playerâ€™s Performances based on Interviews](https://www.overleaf.com/read/vgjtypbppdwy). 

## Requirements

To install requirements:


>ðŸ“‹  To set up the environment you must use python 3. The following libraries must be installed: sklearn, nltk, numpy, TensorFlow version 2, pandas and matplot.pyplot

## Training and model evalutation

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this:

```train
CISC_867_Project.py
```

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :



| Model name         | Accuracy  |
| ------------------ |---------- |
| Neural Network     |   54%     |

>ðŸ“‹  Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it.
