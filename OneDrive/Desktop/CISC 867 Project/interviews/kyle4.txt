Q. It's obviously always frustrating to lose in the playoffs. How much more frustrating is it that this one comes on a night where you guys led for 37 or 38 of the minutes?
KYLE LOWRY: Pretty frustrating. The fourth quarter killed us, 32-17. They outplayed us in that fourth quarter. They got a little bit more aggressive. They made some big shots, made some big plays.

It sucks when you lose like that. But we had a chance, and we've got to learn from it and make an adjustment. Stay even-keeled, never too high, never too low. Just look at the film and get better.

Q. You mentioned the fourth-quarter struggles. At 3:30 you guys take the lead by two. Down the stretch you go scoreless. Was it something they were doing? Did it come down to just missing shots?
KYLE LOWRY: Turnovers, missed shots. We just didn't execute as sharply as we could have. I've got to go back and watch the film. I think we got a couple good shots and we missed some shots, but we just didn't finish the game well. We just didn't play well. Just didn't finish the game.

Q. You had a big game tonight. How do you keep that going for Friday and come out with a win?
KYLE LOWRY: Just whatever it takes to win the game. Individual stuff doesn't do anything for me. I want to win games. Maybe we've got to figure out what we can do better to win win the game and close it out and play better.

Q. How would you compare how the ball moved and the distribution in the first half to the second half?
KYLE LOWRY: Our pace wasn't good enough in the second half. I think that's where we struggled in the second half. Our pace wasn't good enough. I think the pace that we played with in the first half was the pace we needed to play with throughout the game.

I think that will be a big thing for us: pace and dictating the pace of the game.
