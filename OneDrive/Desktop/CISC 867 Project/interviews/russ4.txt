momentum.  Were you frustrated by that?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:  No, man, it's Coach's decision.  Got to live with it.

Q.  You guys have been good all year, kind of compartmentalizing and moving on.  What do you want to see from you and your teammates over the next 48 hours?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:  You know, it was a good game.  We kept them down on shooting, 37 percent.  Just weren't able to close it out.  But we'll do a better job next time.

Q.  You guys played pretty well through most of the game, but you had two stretches where things really fell apart.  Did you sense a sense of panic at that time, unforced errors and those kinds of things?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:  Not really.  Mean, things are going to happen like that throughout a game.  You've just got to be able to stick together and find a way where you can stop the run or stop whatever is going on.

Q.  Between you and Durant, you guys got six free‑throw attempts total.  Do you think that has to do with your aggressiveness, or do you think their defense is playing different?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:  I don't know.  You know, I don't really think too many people shot a lot of free throws tonight anyway.  I don't think that's a big deal.

Q.  Do you typically want to go to the line a little more than just twice in one game?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:  It doesn't really matter.

Q.  What will you remember about this game in terms of the plays that cost you guys from closing this one out?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:  I don't think it's a particular play or plays, just the little things we've got to do, giving them easy lay‑ups.  I mean, I don't know how many paint points they had, but they had a lot of them early on.  Just got to cut that down.

Q.  You got an open three late to tie the game.  Did you notice Erik Spoelstra on the court next to you as you were shooting that?
RUSSELL WESTBROOK:  No, I was trying to make a basket, trying to focus on the rim.
